# Minesweeper

This is a project to learn tkinter for python, and generally train a bit.

The idea is to make a playable minesweeper with a GUI, with the capaility to show some game statistics. Then, I will make a few different attempts at a solver using different techniques.

# TODO

- [ ] Open a window with tkiner
- [ ] Create a board
- [ ] Display board
- [ ] Allow player interaction
- [ ] Playable Minesweeper
- [ ] Add menu for board size and see stats
- [ ] Make AIs (will expand)
